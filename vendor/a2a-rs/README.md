`a2a-rs` is a Rust workspace for the A2A v1 protocol. It includes core protocol
types, async client and server libraries, protobuf definitions, and gRPC
bindings for building interoperable A2A agents and clients.

The workspace supports:

- JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP
- REST / HTTP+JSON
- gRPC via `tonic`
- SLIMRPC via `slim_bindings`
- Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
- Protobuf-based interop with other SDKs and runtimes

## Workspace

| Crate | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `a2a` | Core A2A types, errors, events, JSON-RPC types, and wire-compatible serde behavior |
| `a2a-client` | Async A2A client with transport abstraction and protocol negotiation from agent cards |
| `a2a-server` | Async server framework with REST and JSON-RPC bindings built on `axum` |
| `a2a-pb` | Protobuf schema, generated types, ProtoJSON-capable generated types, and native <-> protobuf conversion helpers |
| `a2a-grpc` | gRPC client and server bindings built on `tonic` |
| `a2a-slimrpc` | SLIMRPC client and server bindings built on `slim_bindings` |
| `a2acli` | Standalone A2A client CLI, published as `a2a-cli`, for inspecting agent cards, sending messages, managing tasks, and handling push configs |
| `examples/helloworld` | Minimal runnable example agent |

## Supported Bindings

| Binding | Client | Server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSON-RPC | `a2a-client` | `a2a-server` |
| HTTP+JSON / REST | `a2a-client` | `a2a-server` |
| gRPC | `a2a-grpc` | `a2a-grpc` |
| SLIMRPC | `a2a-slimrpc` | `a2a-slimrpc` |

The gRPC support uses the schema in `a2a-pb/proto/a2a.proto`. The REST and
JSON-RPC bindings are intended to stay wire-compatible with other A2A SDKs,
including Go and C# implementations.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.85 or newer
- A stable `rustup` toolchain is recommended
- `just` is optional but useful for common development commands
- `cargo-llvm-cov` is optional if you want HTML coverage reports

## Build And Test

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Common project commands are also available through `just`:

```sh
just build
just test
just lint
just fmt-check
just ci
```

## Coverage

Install `cargo-llvm-cov` once:

```sh
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

Then run:

```sh
just coverage
```

This writes the HTML report to `target/llvm-cov/html/index.html`.

## Running The Example Agent

The hello world example exposes an echo-style agent over REST and JSON-RPC.

```sh
cargo run -p helloworld
```

When the example starts, the following endpoints are available:

- Agent card: `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- JSON-RPC endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/jsonrpc`
- REST endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/rest`

The example does not start a gRPC server, but the `a2a-grpc` crate provides the
client and server bindings needed to add one.

## Running The A2A CLI

The workspace includes a standalone CLI client built on `a2a-client`. It
resolves the public agent card from a base URL, negotiates JSON-RPC or
HTTP+JSON, prints responses as JSON, and manages task push notification
configs.

```sh
cargo run --bin a2acli -- card
cargo run --bin a2acli -- send "hello from rust"
cargo run --bin a2acli -- stream "hello from rust"
cargo run --bin a2acli -- list-tasks
cargo run --bin a2acli -- push-config list task-123
```

By default the CLI targets `http://localhost:3000`, which matches the bundled
hello world server. Override the target with `--base-url https://host` for any
compatible A2A server, use `--binding jsonrpc` or `--binding http-json` to pin
transport selection, and pass `--bearer-token` or repeated `--header Name:Value`
arguments when the server requires authentication.

Install from the workspace with `cargo install --path a2acli`, or from crates.io
after release with `cargo install a2a-cli`.

## Depending On The Workspace

Until the crates are published, depend on them directly from Git:

```toml
[dependencies]
a2a = { package = "a2a-lf", git = "https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs.git" }
a2a-client = { package = "a2a-client-lf", git = "https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs.git" }
a2a-server = { package = "a2a-server-lf", git = "https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs.git" }
a2a-pb = { package = "a2a-pb", git = "https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs.git" }
a2a-grpc = { package = "a2a-grpc", git = "https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs.git" }
a2a-slimrpc = { package = "a2a-slimrpc", git = "https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs.git" }
```

Typical usage is:

- `a2a` for protocol types and serde models
- `a2a-client` for clients that negotiate REST or JSON-RPC from an agent card
- `a2a-server` for agent implementations on `axum`
- `a2a-grpc` when you need gRPC transport support
- `a2a-slimrpc` when you need SLIMRPC transport support
- `a2a-pb` when you need direct access to protobuf messages or conversion helpers

## Repository Layout

- `a2a/`: core protocol crate
- `a2a-client/`: client transports and factory
- `a2a-server/`: request handler, routers, streaming, and stores
- `a2a-pb/`: protobuf schema and conversion layer
- `a2a-grpc/`: tonic-based bindings
- `a2a-slimrpc/`: SLIMRPC bindings
- `a2acli/`: standalone A2A client CLI and published binary package
- `examples/helloworld/`: runnable sample agent
